# Pixel-Picks

<br>

## Project Conception:

Our project team would like to have an online/mobile generator to suggest us a game and movie recommendation.
Pixel Picks helps you find a game or movie to watch based on what type you’re in the mood for.
The motivation for this development came from our groups collective enjoyment of media, and wanting to share our picks of what we enjoy when we’re looking for something that reflects a specific mood.

### User Story:
