## Project Conception:

Our project team would like to have an online/mobile generator to suggest us a game and movie recommendation.
Pixel Picks helps you find a game or movie to watch based on what type you’re in the mood for.
The motivation for this development came from our groups collective enjoyment of media, and wanting to share our picks of what we enjoy when we’re looking for something that reflects a specific mood.

## Usage

Determine what your current mood for entertainment is, choose what type of movie and/or video game according to your mood. This application will proceed to give you random results of suggestions based on that mood. If the result is undesirable, click that mood again for another result or choose another mood.
